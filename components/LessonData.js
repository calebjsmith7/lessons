You can obviously dive in way deeper than these few chords, but if you start here; ultimately, you can play in any key. \n\nStay in this lesson until you grasp what each number sounds like and fully understand the Nashville Number System.',

Don\'t worry about chords right now, just focus on the rhythms of the strum pattern and what it feels like. \n\nKeep your wrist loose on both arms. You need to press firmly for the chord but try to put the pressure on your fingers instead of your wrist. On you strumming hand, make it as loose as you can for this exersize. \n\nWhen you feel confident about your strum pattern, pick a song and go to the Resource tab to find a chord chart for it. Practice it till you feel confident combining the chords you learned and the rhythm. Reminder to select the key of G in the chord chart database. ',

It shouldn\'t necessarily feel random but its ok if it does at first. \n\nRemoving just a few notes every bar or two allows for the strum pattern to feel less forced, more natural, and more professional. When you feel confident about your strum pattern tapering, it should make your wrist feel more relaxed, but you should notice an almost immediate improvement in the overal sound quality. \n\nThis is based on feel, but feel free to stay on this lesson until you feel confident in your more natural sounding strum pattern.',

Pick one of your favorite songs that doesnt seem to complicated. Listen to it and pause after a few seconds of a lead line. Find out where this note is on your guitar and find the easiest pattern and write it down. \n\nGo through the whole song until you have all the parts written down. After some practice, try to go through the whole song while it is playing. You may have to do this multiple times until you feel comfortable with the timing.
